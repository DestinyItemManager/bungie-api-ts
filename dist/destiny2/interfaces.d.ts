 *

 * currently active quest for the Milestone in question). Look up the Quests
 * property in the Milestone Definition, and check if it has display properties. If
 * it does, show that as the description of the Milestone. If it doesn't, fall back

 * bar) and the final transformation data (interpolation tables to turn the raw
 * investment stat into a display stat). Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for
 * more information on that transformational process.
 * 
 * Stats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items and types of items
 * can refer to the same stat, but have different "scales" for the stat while still
 * having the same underlying value. For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle
 * may have a "raw" impact stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale
 * that 50 down so that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to
 * the shotgun. (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have
 * naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this)
 * 
 * A final caveat is that some stats, even after this "final" transformation, go
 * through yet another set of transformations directly in the game as a result of
 * dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet has no access to these scripts, nor
 * any way to know which scripts get executed. As a result, the stats for an item
 * that you see in-game - particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks,
 * like Magazine Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net.
 * This is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline. Take these stats
 * with a grain of salt.
 * 
 * Stats actually go through four transformations, for those interested:
 * 
 * 1) "Sandbox" stat, the "most raw" form. These are pretty much useless without
 * transformations applied, and thus are not currently returned in the API. If you
 * really want these, we can provide them. Maybe someone could do something cool
 * with it?
 * 
 * 2) "Investment" stat (the stat's value after DestinyStatDefinition's
 * interpolation tables and aggregation logic is applied to the "Sandbox" stat
 * value)
 * 
 * 3) "Display" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after
 * DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the Investment
 * Stat value. For most stats, this is what is displayed.)
 * 
 * 4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to the game, after
 * the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and character's state. This is
 * the final transformation that BNet does not have access to. For most stats, this
 * is not actually displayed to the user, with the exception of Magazine Size which
 * is then piped back to the UI for display in-game, but not to BNet.)
