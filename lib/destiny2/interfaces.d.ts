 * progression points"/experience. (for simplicity purposes, we will henceforth
 * refer to earned progression points as experience, though it need not be a

 *
 * - Traditional Vendors as you see in game: people who you come up to and who give

 *
 * - Kiosks/Collections, which are really just Vendors that don't charge currency (
 * or charge some pittance of a currency) and whose gating for purchases revolves
 * more around your character's state.
 *
 * - Previews for rewards or the contents of sacks. These are implemented as
 * Vendors, where you can't actually purchase from them but the items that they
 * have for sale and the categories of sale items reflect the rewards or contents
 * of the sack. This is so that the game could reuse the existing Vendor display UI
 * for rewards and save a bunch of wheel reinvention.
 *
 * - Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster. Vendors can have "
 * acceptedItem" buckets that determine the source and destination buckets for
 * transfers. When you interact with such a vendor, these buckets are what gets
 * shown in the UI instead of any items that the Vendor would have for sale. Yep,
 * the Vault is a vendor.
 *
 * It is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more features in the
 * future. They have come to be seen more as generic categorized containers for
 * items than "vendors" in a traditional sense, for better or worse.
 *
 * Where possible and time allows, we'll attempt to split those out into their own
 * more digestible derived "Definitions": but often time does not allow that, as
 * you can see from the above ways that vendors are used which we never split off

/**
 * This represents a stat that's applied to a character or an item (such as a
 * weapon, piece of armor, or a vehicle).
 *
 * An example of a stat might be Attack Power on a weapon.
 *
 * Stats go through a complex set of transformations before they end up being shown
 * to the user as a number or a progress bar, and those transformations are
 * fundamentally intertwined with the concept of a "Stat Group" (
 * DestinyStatGroupDefinition). Items have both Stats and a reference to a Stat
 * Group, and it is the Stat Group that takes the raw stat information and gives it
 * both rendering metadata (such as whether to show it as a number or a progress
 * bar) and the final transformation data (interpolation tables to turn the raw
 * investment stat into a display stat). Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for
 * more information on that transformational process.
 *
 * Stats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items and types of items
 * can refer to the same stat, but have different "scales" for the stat while still
 * having the same underlying value. For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle
 * may have a "raw" impact stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale
 * that 50 down so that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to
 * the shotgun. (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have
 * naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this)
 *
 * A final caveat is that some stats, even after this "final" transformation, go
 * through yet another set of transformations directly in the game as a result of
 * dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet has no access to these scripts, nor
 * any way to know which scripts get executed. As a result, the stats for an item
 * that you see in-game - particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks,
 * like Magazine Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net.
 * This is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline. Take these stats
 * with a grain of salt.
 *
 * Stats actually go through four transformations, for those interested:
 *
 * 1) "Sandbox" stat, the "most raw" form. These are pretty much useless without
 * transformations applied, and thus are not currently returned in the API. If you
 * really want these, we can provide them. Maybe someone could do something cool
 * with it?
 *
 * 2) "Investment" stat (the stat's value after DestinyStatDefinition's
 * interpolation tables and aggregation logic is applied to the "Sandbox" stat
 * value)
 *
 * 3) "Display" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after
 * DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the Investment
 * Stat value. For most stats, this is what is displayed.)
 *
 * 4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to the game, after
 * the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and character's state. This is
 * the final transformation that BNet does not have access to. For most stats, this
 * is not actually displayed to the user, with the exception of Magazine Size which
 * is then piped back to the UI for display in-game, but not to BNet.)

 * In Destiny 2, for now, talent grids have become exclusively used by Subclass/
 * Build items: but the system is still in place for it to be used by items should
 * the direction change back toward talent grids.
 *
 * Talent Grids have Nodes: the visual circles on the talent grid detail screen
 * that have icons and can be activated if you meet certain requirements and pay
 * costs. The actual visual data and effects, however, are driven by the "Steps" on
 * Talent Nodes. Any given node will have 1:M of these steps, and the specific step
 * that will be considered the "current" step (and thus the dictator of all
 * benefits, visual state, and activation requirements on the Node) will almost
 * always not be determined until an instance of the item is created. This is how,
 * in Destiny 1, items were able to have such a wide variety of what users saw as "
 * Perks": they were actually Talent Grids with nodes that had a wide variety of
 * Steps, randomly chosen at the time of item creation.
 *
 * Now that Talent Grids are used exclusively by subclasses and builds, all of the
 * properties within still apply: but there are additional visual elements on the
 * Subclass/Build screens that are superimposed on top of the talent nodes.
 * Unfortunately, BNet doesn't have this data: if you want to build a subclass
 * screen, you will have to provide your own "decorative" assets, such as the
 * visual connectors between nodes and the fancy colored-fire-bathed character
 * standing behind the nodes.
 *
 * DestinyInventoryItem.talentGrid.talentGridHash defines an item's linked Talent
 * Grid, which brings you to this definition that contains enough satic data about
 * talent grids to make your head spin. These *must* be combined with instanced
 * data - found when live data returns DestinyItemTalentGridComponent - in order to
 * derive meaning. The instanced data will reference nodes and steps within these
 * definitions, which you will then have to look up in the definition and combine
 * with the instanced data to give the user the visual representation of their item'

   * Let's talk about character-specific data that might be related to items without
   * instances. These two statements are totally unrelated, I promise.
   *
   * At some point during D2, it was decided that items - such as Bounties - could be

   *

   * was keyed by item's instance IDs and provided the stateful information you
   * needed inside.

   * information even if it's in Account-level inventory - and the values related to
   * that item's state in relation to the given character.
   *
   * To give a concrete example, look at a Moments of Triumph bounty. They exist in a
   * character's inventory, and show/care about a character's progression toward
   * completing the bounty. But the bounty itself is a non-instanced item, like a mod
   * or a currency. This returns that data for the characters who have the bounty in
   * their inventory.

 * currently active quest for the Milestone in question). Look up the Quests
 * property in the Milestone Definition, and check if it has display properties. If

 * properties that the Node provides. Examine this and
 * DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition carefully. *IMPORTANT NOTE* Talent Nodes are,

 * and Steps, those hashes are not guaranteed to be immutable across content
